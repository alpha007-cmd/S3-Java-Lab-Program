# S3 Java and Data Structure Lab Programs - KTU Scheme 2019

This repository contains Java programs and data structure exercises for the S3 (Semester 3) Java and Data Structures lab as per the KTU (Kerala Technological University) 2019 scheme.

## Overview

This repository is intended to help students by providing examples of various Java programs and data structures used in lab sessions for KTU's S3 course. Each program aligns with the lab requirements and covers topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Ensure JDK 8 or above is installed.
- **IDE** - Any Java IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
- **Basic Knowledge** of Java programming and data structures.

## Running the Programs

1. Clone or download the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alpha007-cmd/S3-Lab-Program
    ```

2. Open the repository in your preferred Java IDE or editor.

3. **Important**: Before running a program, ensure that the `class` name matches the filename. In Java, the `public class` name must match the file name. Update the `class` name if necessary before executing the program.

4. Compile and run each program as needed.

## Directory Structure

- `ArrayPrograms/` - Programs demonstrating various operations on arrays.
- `LinkedListPrograms/` - Linked list implementations and operations.
- `StackPrograms/` - Stack data structure programs.
- `QueuePrograms/` - Queue implementations and operations.
- `TreePrograms/` - Binary tree and binary search tree operations.
- `SortingAlgorithms/` - Sorting techniques such as bubble sort, selection sort, and more.
- Additional lab-related exercises.
